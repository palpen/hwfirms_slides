- previous literature said that this is because of government policies that forced firms to stay small
- the policies, in addition, causes a misallocation of risources and lower income


This paper suggests that the negative relationship between income and share working in small firms is because of preferences
- Why? because low income people demand lower quality goods
- Lower quality goods are more efficiently produced in small plants
- thus, low income correlates with smaller firms
